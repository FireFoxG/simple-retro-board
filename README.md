# WCMS Retro

Simple Spring application for our Retro board project

Things to-do:
 * Introduce some self-contained database
 * Create DAOs for easier use
 * Introduce some kind of history?


# Getting started

 Clone project into local repo, make sure java JDK and maven are installed

 ```
 npm i
 npm run-script build
 npm start
 ```
 
 Server should be running, hopefully!
