# simple-retro-board

Simple Spring application for our Retro board project

Current version is purely POC, so that frontend could get some mock data
Things to-do:
 * Introduce some self-contained database
 * Create DAOs for easier use
 * Introduce some kind of history?


# Getting started

 Clone project into local repo, make sure java JDK and maven are installed

 ```npm i
 mvn clean install
 npm run-script start```
 
 Server should be running, hopefully!
